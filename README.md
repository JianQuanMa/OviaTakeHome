This app is to take an input of some search keyword and find a list of movies that contain the keyword(first 10 for now).

I used mvvm since I think passing data with mvvm would make it easier to implement and more modulized. 

I used google, quickType, stackOverflow, apple doc for this project. 

I used postman for some api testing, no third party libraries used in this project. 

I spent 4 = (2+1+1) hours on this project. If I have more time, I would modulize all network reponse (so including image request), I would add more option to search result,
such as type and return count, maybe make some pagination or pages on the viewcontroller's tableview.

I finished the project. I am a bit rusty on writting reponse structs and some UIs, costed me more than half hour to figure out I forgot to set tableView.deledate = self in viewcontroller.
